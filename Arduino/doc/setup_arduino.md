### Install a Library

In order to use the RGB Matrix shield, you need to load the library as follows.

In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library. At the top of the drop down list, select the option to "Add .ZIP Library''.  
![IDE](images/IDE.png)

You will be prompted to select the library you would like to add. Here we find **lib.zip** (In the *RGB_Matrix_lib\Arduino* in the folder you just downloaded) . Navigate to the .zip file's location and open it.

Return to the Sketch > Include Library menu. menu. You should now see the library at the bottom of the drop-down menu. It is ready to be used in your sketch. The zip file will have been expanded in the libraries folder in your Arduino sketches directory.

>The Library will be available to use in sketches, but with older IDE versions examples for the library will not be exposed in the File > Examples until after the IDE has restarted.

>For more information on installing the library, please see [HERE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).
